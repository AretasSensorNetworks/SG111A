# SG111A
Firmware for SG111A

For now, a basic Arduino-compatible sketch for the SG111A CO2 sensor using software UART

I'm still working on the CRC16 implementation and sensor characterization, so for now, just the test sketch. 

Update 14-07-2019 - Characterization is complete, the sensor tracks well with reference and responds well to calibration references.

Expect to see a library, example documentation and more from this repo soon. We'll also provide examples for Java, Python, etc.
