# SG111A
Firmware for SG111A

For now, a basic Arduino-compatible sketch for the SG111A CO2 sensor using software UART

I'm still working on the CRC16 implementation and sensor characterization, so for now, just the test sketch. 

Expect to see a library, example documentation and more from this repo soon.
